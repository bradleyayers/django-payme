<h1>Welcome to Mamona test app</h1>
<p>Here you can click and feel three approaches to payments which Mamona offers you. The purpose of this
test is to see how flexible application it is.</p>

<h2>Approach 1: Single item</h2>
<p>First of all, we demonstrate single item sale via <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>.
Using this, you may also support author of Mamona.</p>

<form action="{% url mamona:prepare payment.content_type.pk payment.pk %}" method="post">
    <p>Would you like to make a <strong>{{ order.name }}</strong> for just <strong>{{ order.total }} {{ order.currency }}</strong>?</p>
    <button type="submit">Yes, I will gladly donate to such a decent man!</button>
</form>

<h2>Approach 2: More complex order</h2>
<p>You will be asked to <a href="{% url sales-order-multiitem %}">assemble some multi-item order</a>.</p>

<h2>Approach 3: Everything on a single screen</h2>
<p>Mamona can handle many tasks for you. But you may also shift some logic into your application
and ask customer <a href="{% url sales-order-singlescreen %}">all the questions on a single screen</a>.</p>
